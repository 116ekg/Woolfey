                JR is a software engineering whiz with a passion for creative design and technical innovation. Despite the 
                breakout success of his first project, Syrup, he decided to leave the dating industry and try his hand at 
                cryptocurrency. His rise to fame has made him a household name in the tech industry, and now he’s hoping to 
                strike gold a second time, with his new project, Woolfey. Outside of work, you’ll find him at the gym, 
                watching sports, or searching for the perfect breakfast burrito.
